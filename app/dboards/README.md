- [Dashboard playlists](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/wiki/Dashboard-playlist)

### InfluxDB
- [Use InfluxDB](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/wiki/InfluxDB) as metric datasource

# Requirements
Grafana is very easy to install. It is a client side web app with no backend. Any webserver will do. Optionally you will need ElasticSearch if you want to be able to save and load dashboards quickly instead of json files or local storage.

# Installation
- Download and extract the [latest release](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/releases).
- Rename `config.sample.js` to `config.js`, then change `graphiteUrl` and `elasticsearch` to point to the correct urls. The urls entered here must be reachable by your browser.
- Point your browser to the installation.

To run from master:
- Clone this repository
- Start a web server in src folder
- Or create a optimized & minified build:
 - npm install (requires nodejs)
 - grunt build (requires grunt-cli)

If you use ansible for provisioning and deployment [ansible-grafana](https://github.com/bobrik/ansible-grafana) should get you started.

When you have Grafana up an running, read the [Getting started](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/wiki/Getting-started) guide for
an introduction on how to use Grafana and/or watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUvJamHeMpw) for a guide in creating a new dashboard and for creating
templated dashboards.

# Graphite server config
If you haven't used an alternative dashboard for graphite before you need to enable cross-domain origin request. For Apache 2.x:
```
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, OPTIONS"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "origin, authorization, accept"
```
Note that using "\*" leaves your graphite instance quite open so you might want to consider using "http://my.graphite-dom.ain" in place of "\*"

Here is the same thing, in nginx format:
```
add_header  "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" "*"; 
add_header  "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials" "true";
add_header  "Access-Control-Allow-Methods" "GET, OPTIONS";
add_header  "Access-Control-Allow-Headers" "Authorization, origin, accept";
```
If your Graphite web is protected by basic authentication, you have to enable the HTTP verb OPTIONS, origin
(no wildcards are allowed in this case) and add Access-Control-Allow-Credentials. This looks like the following for Apache:
```
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "http://mygrafana.com:5656"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Credentials true

<Location />
    AuthName "graphs restricted"
    AuthType Basic
    AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/htpasswd
    <LimitExcept OPTIONS>
      require valid-user
    </LimitExcept>
</Location>
```
And in nginx:
```
auth_basic            "Restricted";
auth_basic_user_file  /path/to/my/htpasswd/file;
if ($http_origin ~* (https?://[^/]*\.somedomain\.com(:[0-9]+)?)) {  #Test if request is from allowed domain, you can use multiple if
    set $cors "true";                                               #statements to allow multiple domains, simply setting $cors to true in each one.
}
if ($cors = 'true') {
    add_header  Access-Control-Allow-Origin $http_origin;           #this mirrors back whatever domain the request came from as authorized, as
    add_header  "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials" "true";          #as long as it matches one of your if statements
    add_header  "Access-Control-Allow-Methods" "GET, OPTIONS";
    add_header  "Access-Control-Allow-Headers" "Authorization, origin, accept";
}
```
# Roadmap
- Improve and refine the target parser and editing
- Improve graphite import feature
- Refine and simplify common tasks
- More panel types (not just graphs)
- Use elasticsearch to search for metrics
- Improve template support
- Annotate graph by querying ElasticSearch for events (or other event sources)

# Contribute
If you have any idea for an improvement or found a bug do not hesitate to open an issue. And if you have time clone this repo and submit a pull request and help me make Grafana the kickass metrics & devops dashboard we all dream about!

Clone repository:
- npm install
- grunt server (starts development web server in src folder)
- grunt (runs jshint and less -> css compilation)

# Notice
This software is based on the great log dashboard [kibana](https://github.com/elasticsearch/kibana).
