Compass-Web
===========

`Compass-Web` is a web-based UI consuming the Restful API service provided by [Compass](https://github.com/stackforge/compass-core) to pragmatically deploy  OpenStack or other distributed systems on to a set of raw physical resources.  It can be used as a base to develop a UI for more sophisticated use cases.

Currently it has 2 versions:
[v1](v1/README.md)
[v2](v2/README.md)
